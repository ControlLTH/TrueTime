TrueTime 2.0 beta 2, 2009-05-11
===============================
* A serious bug in the Kernel block with regard to multiple Kernel
  blocks in the same model has been fixed.
* Monitor schedule gone.
* Trigger type (raising, falling, either) can be specified for the external
  interrupts port.
* Receive block has new output: the time stamp of the message. 

TrueTime 2.0 beta 1, 2009-01-14
===============================
New Kernel/Network block features:
* Automatic connections between Kernel/Network/Send/Receive blocks
  using hidden Goto/From blocks. The connections are configured in the
  block dialogues. This makes it much easier to connect a kernel block
  to several Network blocks. 
* In the masks it is now possible to hide/show most block inputs and
  outputs (removes the need for Ground and Terminator blocks).
* Name changes: The ttGetMsg and ttSendMsg blocks are now called
  TrueTime Send and TrueTime Receive instead.
* The Receive block can output the timestamp of the message (telling 
  when was sent).
* The Send and Receive blocks now support vector data inputs and
  outputs.
* The time resolution of the kernel and network blocks is now
  explicitely declared to be 1e-12.
* New Ultrasound Network block.
* Possibility to set initial seeds for the pseudo-random number
  generators in the Network and Wireless network blocks.

Changes in the Kernel block:
* Number of analog inputs, outputs, external triggers, and network
  connections are now configured in the block dialogue. ttInitKernel
  has new syntax. ttInitNetwork and ttCreateExternalTrigger have been
  replaced by ttAttachNetworkHandler and ttAttachTriggerHandler.
  ttAttachNetworkHandler is optional (not needed if you use polling).
* The same handler may now be associated with any number of interrupt
  sources (network, trigger or wcet/deadline overrun). The more
  general function ttGetInvoker replaces the old ttInvokingTask.
* In the C++ API, new functions ttSetUserData and ttGetUserData can be
  used for proper memory allocation/deallocation in init()/free(),
  allowing multiple instances of the same block.
* New functions ttCreateCBS/ttAttachCBS/ttSetCBSParameters can be used
  for simulation of constant bandwidth servers. Under EDF scheduling, a
  task associated with a CBS inherits the deadline of the CBS.
* ttCreateJob can now be used to schedule future task instances.
* Name changes: ttCreateInterruptHandler is now ttCreateHandler.
  ttNonPreemptable is now ttNonPreemptible.
* ttNonPreemptible now also works for interrupt handlers.
* ttCreateLog now allows the creation of "free" logs, not associated
  with any particular tasks. ttLogNow and ttLogValue are used to write
  time or values to them.
* ttCreateTask and ttCreatePeriodicTask no longer take the priority as
  in input argument. Use ttSetPriority for each task if you want to
  use fixed-priority scheduling.
* Rate-monotonic scheduling did not make sense for aperiodic tasks and
  has therefore been dropped - use deadline monotonic instead (by
  default, deadline=period for periodic tasks anyway). 
* A first release instance may now be specified for ttCreateTask.
* ttUltrasoundPing is used to send a short pulse over an ultrasound
  network. 
* Complete re-implementation of handlers, timers and scheduling hooks.

TrueTime 1.5, 2007-01-04
=========================
Features added:
* Major performance improvements when using the network blocks. The simulation
  time is now linear rather than exponential in the simulated time. (The poor
  performance in previous versions was due to Matlab's memory management.)
* Two new Simulink blocks added, making it easier to develop networked
  applications. The two blocks makes it possible to send and receive network
  messages without using kernel blocks and code functions. A related new
  example is also added.
* ttDiscardMessages now returns the total number of discarded messages.
* ttGetInitArg (C++) primitive added.
* New Mote Soccer example added, showing how many nodes can be configured
  using the same init scripts and code functions.
Bugs removed:
* ttRetrieve gave a segmentation violation if ttFetch was not called properly.
* ttTryFetch did not unblock tasks that were blocked on ttPost
* ttTryPost did not unblock tasks that were blocked on ttFetch
* ttFetch: A blocked writer was never woken up.
* Segmentation violation when creating a timer using a non-existent interrupt
  handler.
* Propagation of clock drift from kernel nodes to network transmission
  schedule.
* 802.11 did not back off correctly on the first try when sensing that the 
  medium was busy.
* ttDiscardMessages did not work as expected with the wireless network.
* ttLogNow, ttLogStart and ttLogStop sometimes wrong when using clock drift.
* Switched Ethernet did not function properly

TrueTime 1.4, 2006-09-21
=========================
* Support for blocking mailboxes (ttPost, ttFetch, ttRetrieve) added.
* Support for semaphores (ttCreateSemaphore, ttTake, ttGive) added.
* ttGetData and ttSetData primitives added.
* ttAbortSimulation primitive added.
* ttDiscardUnsentMessages primitive added.
* Bug in ttwnetwork.cpp regarding probability of packet losses fixed.
* Bug in ttwnetwork.cpp regarding the number of retransmissions fixed.
* Bug in ttwnetwork.cpp and ttnetwork.cpp regarding deletion of
  temporary global variables fixed.
* Message lengths in ttSendMsg are now given in bits instead of bytes.
* Support for user defined pathloss function added to the wireless
  network block. It can only be used in the Matlab version.
* Problem reading inputs at time zero fixed.
* Major performance improvements (>100% speedup of the execution of the
  kernel block) in the Matlab version.
* New AODV routing example added.

TrueTime 1.3, 2005-06-28
=========================
* Support for Matlab 6.1 (R12.1) has been dropped.
* Added support for wireless networks.
* Added support for Dynamic Voltage Scaling by the use of ttSetKernelParameter.
* Added support for clock drift and offsets, configured in the kernel mask.
* Added support for power consumption and batteries.
* Added two new examples treating the wireless network block and power
  consumption using batteries.
* Added support for setting pre-and postdelay on a per node basis by using
  ttSetNetworkParameter.

TrueTime 1.2, 2004-10-15
=========================
* New internal data structures and a revised implementation of the 
  kernel block S-function.
* Support for Matlab 7.0 (R14), Matlab 6.5 (R13), and Matlab 6.1 (R12.1).
* MATLAB help for the TrueTime commands, try for example

  >> help ttInitKernel

* Broadcast of network messages
* Support for logging of task attributes
* Arrival hook added. Usually coincides with the release hook unless there
  is a pending job of the task when the new job is created. In that case the 
  execution of the release hook will be postponed until the job is activated 
  from the job queue. 
* Syntax of ttCreateJob has been changed. ttCreateJob always creates a 
  job at the current time. To create a job at a specific time, use a timer.
* Two new tutorial examples included, treating task synchronization and 
  deadline overrun handling.
* Several bug fixes.

TrueTime 1.13, 2003-10-23
=========================
* Changes in the network block:
  - Automatic division of messages into frames has been removed. This feature
    should be implemented by higher protocol layers in the computer nodes, if
    desired. The "Max framesize" and "Frame overhead" parameters have
    consequently been removed.
  - Switched Ethernet has been added as a network type, with new parameters
    describing the switch buffer memory.
* Bug in ttCallBlockSystem fixed
* ttmex command added

TrueTime 1.12, 2003-08-06
=========================
* Minor bug workaround for Matlab 6.1 (R12.1) added

TrueTime 1.11, 2003-06-24 
=========================
* Support for several network blocks in the same model
* Improved error-handling, fail-safe execution flag removed
* Common version for both Matlab 6.1 (R12.1) and Matlab 6.5 (R13)

TrueTime 1.1, 2003-03-28 
=========================
* Major new release, new syntax

TrueTime 1.0, 2002-07-18 
========================
* First release of TrueTime
